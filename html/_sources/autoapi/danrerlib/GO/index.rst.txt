   GO Module
   ===========

   The Gene Ontology (GO) module provides functions for retrieving gene information associated with 
   Gene Ontology Biological Process (BP), Molecularfunctionsns (MF) and Cellular Components (CC)
   for various organisms, including human, zebrafish, and mapped zebrafish.

   Functions:
       - ``get_genes_in_GO_concept``: Retrieve genes associated with a specific GO concept ID.

   Constants:
       - ``NCBI_ID``: Identifier for NCBI Gene ID.
       - ``ZFIN_ID``: Identifier for ZFIN ID.
       - ``ENS_ID``: Identifier for Ensembl ID.
       - ``SYMBOL``: Identifier for gene Symbol.
       - ``HUMAN_ID``: Identifier for Human NCBI Gene ID.

   Database Rebuild Functions:
       - ``build_gene_ontology_database``: Build or update the gene ontology database.

   Notes:
       - This module is designed for accessing gene information from Gene Ontology.
       - It provides functions to retrieve gene data associated with biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions.
       - Data is obtained either through reading pre-processed files from the database build.
       - Organism options include 'dre' (Danio rerio), 'hsa' (Human), or 'dreM' (Mapped Danio rerio from Human).

   Example:
       To retrieve genes associated with a specific GO concept ID:
       ```
       go_genes = get_genes_in_GO_concept('GO:0007582', 'dre')
       ```

   For detailed information on each function and their usage, please refer to the documentation. For more examples of full functionality, please refer to tutorials.

.. py:function:: get_genes_in_GO_concept(concept_id: str, organism: str, gene_id_type: Optional[str] = None) -> pandas.Series

   Retrieve gene IDs associated with a Gene Ontology (GO) concept for a specified organism.

   Parameters:
       - ``concept_id (str)``: The Gene Ontology (GO) concept ID for which gene IDs are to be retrieved.
       - ``organism (str)``: The organism for which gene IDs should be retrieved. Options include

                      - 'hsa': Human.
                      - 'dre': Zebrafish.
                      - 'dreM': Mapped Zebrafish from Human (same as 'dre' as Zebrafish GO IDs are not characterized).

       - ``gene_id_type (str, optional)``: The desired gene ID type for the returned gene IDs. Default is None.

   Returns:
      - ``gene_ids_series (pd.Series)``: A pandas Series containing gene IDs associated with the specified GO concept.

   Raises:
       ValueError: If the GO concept ID does not exist for the given organism or if the organism is invalid.

   Notes:
       - This function retrieves gene IDs associated with a Gene Ontology (GO) concept for a specified organism.
       - The 'concept_id' parameter should be a valid GO concept identifier.
       - The 'organism' parameter specifies the organism for which gene IDs should be retrieved.
       - Options for 'organism' include 'hsa' (Human), 'dre' (Zebrafish), or 'dreM' (Mapped Zebrafish from Human).

   Example:
       To retrieve Zebrafish gene IDs associated with a GO concept:
       ```
       concept_id = 'GO:0001234'
       organism = 'dre'
       gene_ids = get_genes_in_GO_concept(concept_id, organism)
       ```


.. py:function:: id_exists_given_organism(concept_id: str, organism: str)

   Check if a Gene Ontology (GO) ID exists for the specified organism.

   Parameters:
       - ``concept_id (str)``: The GO ID to be validated.
       - ``organism (str)``: The specified organism code (e.g., 'hsa', 'dre', or 'dreM').

   Returns:
       - bool: True if the GO ID exists for the specified organism, False otherwise.

   Raises:
       - ValueError: If the organism code is invalid.

   Notes:
       - This function checks whether a given GO ID exists for the specified organism.
       - It reads a GO ID data file and looks for a match in the 'GO ID' column.
       - The 'organism' parameter specifies the organism code for which to perform the check.
       - Returns True if the GO ID exists for the organism, False otherwise.
       - Provides an error message if the organism code is invalid.


.. py:function:: build_gene_ontology_database()

   Build or update the Gene Ontology (GO) database.

   Notes:
       - This function is intended for database creation or update and should be run only during version updates.
       - The process may take some time, so exercise caution when running it.
       - The function performs the following steps:
       
           1. Downloads all current GO IDs.
           2. Builds the human GO file and with IDs and associated genes.
           3. Builds the zebrafish GO file and with IDs and associated genes.
           5. Builds the mapped zebrafish GO file and with IDs and associated genes.
           6. Add a column to the database file to identify if the GO ID exists for human and/or zebrafish. 

       - Running this function should be done carefully, as it involves downloading and processing data fromGO.
